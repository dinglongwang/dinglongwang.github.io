Here are some notes/papers/posts/MO answers I really like:

- [Set Theory for Category Theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0810.1279.pdf) - Mike Shulman. 
This solved many set-theoretic questions of mine, who don't know any set theory beyond basic axioms.

- [Notes on Grothendieck topologies, fibered categories and descent theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0412512) - Angelo Vistoli.
This is a set of notes on important 1(+1)-categorical constructions.

- [An explanation for the Q in straightening over a point](https://mathoverflow.net/a/392804/481243) - Charles Rezk.
I took this as granted when I was looking at HTT and didn't bother to work it out. This might be helpful for someone who wants to truly understand the technical straightening/unstraightening in HTT.
