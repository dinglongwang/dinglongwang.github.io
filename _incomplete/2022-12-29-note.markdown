This is a Rapid Introduction to Bordism (I write it in abbreviation because I don't dare to write it as my title but RIB is fun). I am reading Adams' blue book but I feel sad that I don't know how does one prove any spectrum is the spectrum of a relatively complicated (co)homology theory. But fortunately, I saw "Notes on Cobordism" by Haynes Miller and it instantly catches me. The following sums up the first 3 sections in his book.

It begins with Steenrod's question. Here I read "Duality on Compact Manifolds with Boundary" in "Topology and Geometry" by Glen E. Bredon. I'll skip it because the formulation of bordism is beautiful on its own.

We consider smooth category.

$\bf{Definition}:$

   	
1. A closed manifold M is null-bordant if M=$\partial$ W for some manifold W.

2. A singular manifold (M,f), i.e. $f:M\rightarrow X$, M closed, is null-bordant if there exists an $F:W\rightarrow X$ extending f as above.
3. (M,f)~(N,g) if (M$\amalg$N,(f,g)) is null-bordant.
