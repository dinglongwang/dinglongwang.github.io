Hi, I am Dinglong Wang, a math undergraduate at UIUC. This website is just used to deposit and share my notes. It will be focused on topology more. I don't know if I can resist the short-term temptation to read more and instead, write things down for future reference. So there will not be too many notes (at least now) and they are just going to be details or even "trivial" things. There must be lots of carefully written notes that have better quality and depth. But it's easier for me to find things from my own notes.

Aesthetically, I like algebraic topology.
