Hi, I am Dinglong Wang, a math undergraduate at UIUC. This website is just used to deposit and share my notes. It will be focused on topology more. I don't know if I can resist the short-term temptation to read more and instead, write things down for future reference. So there will not be too many notes (at least now) and they are just going to be details or even "trivial" things. 

Aesthetically, I like algebraic topology.
