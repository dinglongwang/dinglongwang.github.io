Hi, I am Dinglong Wang, a math undergraduate at UIUC. This website is just used to deposit and share my notes. I don’t know if I can resist the short-term temptation to read more and communicate with real people but instead, write things down for future reference. So there will not be too many notes and many notes will be unfinished (at least now). They are just going to be details because it’s not very useful for me to write down the big picture when I am not used to think in that subject. It will come up retrospectively.

Aesthetically, I like homotopy theory and representation theory.
