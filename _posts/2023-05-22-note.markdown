### Introduction

Arguably, the most important idea in category theory is the Yonenda lemma, whose significance lies in both mathematics and philosophy. The statement involves the category of presheaf of sets.

All of the above admits a generalization to the theory of ∞-category.

In HTT, Lurie presents three seemingly "competitive" models for ∞-categories of presheaf. But it later turns out that they are equivalent, so they can work together like join/slice and alternate join/slice.

Here we rewrite all the proofs using theory worked out in Rezk's note, which is simpler for once you remember the important theorems.

### Definitions

Given $C$ a quasicategory, we can define the presheaf over $C$ to be

1. $\mathcal P(C)$:=Fun($C^{op}$, $\mathcal{S}$), where $\mathcal{S}$ is the ∞-category of spaces, i.e., $N^{\Delta}(Kan)$.
2. $\mathcal P'(C)$:= $N^{\Delta}(P'\_{\Delta}(C))$, where $P'\_{\Delta}(C)$ is the full subcategory of the overcategory $sSet_{/C}$, spanned by right fibrations.
3. $\mathcal P^{\'\'}(\phi):=(sSet^C)_{cf}$, where $\phi:\mathfrak{C}[S] \rightarrow C$ is an equivalence of simplicial category, $sSet^C$ is the category of *simplicial* functors from C to sSet, equipped with the induced projective model structure ($\phi$ is not used here. It is used in the (un)straightening process).

Some justifications can be made. 

(1) is the most straightforward in the context of quasicategory, simply uses the internal Hom (function complex) to replace the Hom.

(2) is relatively harder. First of all, it is well-defined because $P^{\'}\_{\Delta}(C)$ is a fibrant simplicial category, which is sent to the fibrant object in simplicial set (Joyal model structure), i.e., quasicategory. It is also clear that $P^{\'}\_{\Delta}(C)$ is a collection of quasicategories fibered in quasigroupoids with base $C$.

(3) can be viewed as simplicial nerve of the simplicial presheaves over $C^{op}$. In the special case $\phi=id$ and $C=\mathfrak{C}[S]^{op}$, this is indeed the simplicial presheaves over $\mathfrak{C}[S]$.

These models turn out to be equivalent but the proof involves theory of simplicial category apparently so I will not present it here.

### Limits/Colimits in $\infty$-categories of presheaf
A big advantange of presheaf category is that it admits (small) limits and colimits. This is also true in the $\infty$-category analogue. In fact, this can be computed pointwise. (Under construction)
