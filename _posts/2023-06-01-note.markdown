This post is essentially a continuation of my talk (very bad because of the jet lag). The main reference will be Lurie's notes on chromatic homotopy.

Before we talk about the specific stack of formal group laws, first of all, what is a stack? Here I recommend the appendix in A. Vistoli's [intersection theory on algebraic stacks and their moduli spaces](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF01388892.pdf). For a very intuitive explanation which requires minimal background (even no algebraic geometry is involved for the topological stack part), see chapter 1 of [moduli spaces](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/moduli-spaces/4F295B879A393BF45EFAB547C764AC49) written by K. Behrend. 


**1. Construction**

*-A group represents symmetries. A groupoid represents a family of symmetries.*

Here we are, looking at the groupoids parametrized by the commutative ring.
